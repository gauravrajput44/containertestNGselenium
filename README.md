# containertestNGselenium

This project is demo example to run selnium test NG test cases in docker container and running as docker image.
Step to run: 1) Check-out or clone the project      
             2) Go to folder /container-test where you can see pom.xml
             3) Run mvn clean package
             4) Now run docker-compose up -d
             5) If you want to remove all the container so run docker-compose down
             
Note: I assume you should have docker, java and mvn installed in your system
